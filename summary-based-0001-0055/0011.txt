" Summary of Ash Wednesday "
The poem # takes the reader 
# through stages in a speaker's
faith . At first , he is hopeless 
and overly concerned with his
own human error and inability 
to accept God filly into his
heart . As the poem progresses 
he goes through a series of
metaphorical transformation in which 
he's eaten by white #
leopards and made to climb 
up a staircase away from 
the past . These trials improve 
him and help him leave 
behind the sins of the 
past .
