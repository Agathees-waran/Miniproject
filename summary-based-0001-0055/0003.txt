The most recent GLOF incident was recorded 
in May 2020 , when the # water #
outbrust washed through Hunza Valley . Prior 
to that , another one occurred back in
# July 2019 , when the infrastrature and 
crops in Chitral's Golain Valley sustained 
severe damage , indicating how #
climate emergenecy has already started #
wreaking # havoc . With a count of
almost 7,000 glaciers , Pakistan has more 
glaciers than any other # place on 
the # Earth after the # polar 
regions . Interestingly , the UN Developmemt Program
me (UNDP) had estimated in January 
that # over 3,000 glacial #
lakes have formed in the Hindukush-Himala
yan region , with 33 posing an immin-
ent threat that could impact as many
