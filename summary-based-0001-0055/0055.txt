My Favourite Personlity :-
Allama Iqbal is my favourite Personlity 
because he was a great Poet and as well 
as a scholar . # # # #
dreams of Quaid-e-Azam . Because of
his struggle we are get a good 
education and we should try to make
ourselves # like him . Now when 
we read his books # we are
very impress from him . Why because 
# in that time he was very 
struggle for their future & as well as
for our futur . Now we should try 
to go on # their way . Now we
should try to make their # selves 
a great Personality like him . 
And # help the Students .
