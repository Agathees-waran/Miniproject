We know that many solids dissolve 
When # are put into liquids . When # 
somethings dissolves , it forms a # solution . A
solution is a homogenous mixture of two or
more components . The mixture of salt and 
water is a solution . We use many solution 
everyday .
All solution are the mixture of two or
more substances . The substances in less # 
amount is called solute . The substance in 
which solute is dissolved is called solvent . 
The solvent is always more is quantity 
than a # solute . Can you explain 
solute and solvent in a solution of salt 
and water ?
Solvent + solute -> solution .
