Character is controlled by many genes in 
additive way is called polygenic # Inheritance .

of trait which lies in between # 
two extreme such trait are termed # as 
Quantitative traits . Qualitative traits which 
is controlled # by a single gene and do 
not have many differences among each other 
called qualitative traits. Qualitative traits does
# not lies in a Specific range in
b/w two extreme # # as they can easily be
