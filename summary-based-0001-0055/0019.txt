Often we see Indian and Pakistani cricketers
screaming in front of cameras . They # show that
how emotional they are and also they belong to
emotional  # countries . Eastern countries are mostly 
considered as emotional but it is entirely #
subjective claim and there is no science behind it .
But the question here is that how this perception get
developed ? This question can be answered by the #
concept giving by Edward Said in his book and the
# series of lectures which he had given in America , 
in a book called Orientalism . He # emphasized
that how Western critics , writers think inferior of
Eastern world . He stated that Western countries thought 
ill and had developed stereotypes to distort and
denounce Eastern world . On contrary Western # # 
critics introduced the idea of Occidentalism , which 
is the antithesis of Orientalism . They said that
Edward Said ignored this concept that Eastern world 
always copy Western World in all regards of life .
