we see in our society , womens are just limited 
to their homes . They are mostly depend upon
their males even for a minor things . In our pakista-
ni society they are not allowed to go outside
to earn money , especially in our pashtoon
society.  So this kind of things was very 
common when there was no education , but 
now a days when education becomes comm-
on especially girls education this kind of
problem have been reduced . Now its Our 1st
need to overcome these kind of problems
that a women's face in their day to day
life . we can # overcome these problems throu-
gh education and to # empower 
women , through women empowerment these kinds
of problem will be # reduced or
will be # eliminat for society .
