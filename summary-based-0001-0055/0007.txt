In every age or time , there 
are goodness and badness ,
intelligence and stupidity , faith 
and doubt . # There are 
knowledge and ignorance , #
hope and hopelessness . Each
and every society represents 
both aspects of life  i-e 
evil and goodness . Now it 
is upto human whether to
# choose good path or
bad . We should recognize ourselves 
# We should recognize our 
motives and # the reality of
life . Our choices are very 
important because whatever # we
choose , has a direct impact on 
our # personality .
