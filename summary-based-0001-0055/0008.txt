We are the hollow men .
We are the stuffed men .
Leaning together 
# Headpiece filled with straw
# Alas !
Our dried voices , when 
We # whisper together 
Are quite and meaningless 
As wind in dry grass 
Or rat's feet over 
broken glass .
In our dry # 
celler . 
Shape without form , # shade without 
colour , Paralysed force , gesture without motion ,
Those who have crossed with direct 
eyes , to death's other kingdom 
Remember us - If at all - not as lost .
