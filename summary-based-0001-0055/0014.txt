Literature is a mirror # # which 
reflects the real image of society . 
It discribes the good and the 
# bad aspect of each and 
every thing existing with in # our 
society . Some of literary people 
prefer art for the sake of 
art # phenominan , however some 
prefer art for the # sake of 
knowledge and life . 
Different people have different 
thoughts , there fore each piece of 
writing # varies from one to another . Art 
for the sake of art's purpose is 
to beautify their writing by #
using # figures of speech and 
other literary devices While art for 
the sake of life's purpose # is # 
to show the meaning of life .
