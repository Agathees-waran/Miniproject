" NATURE "
NATURE is the most beautiful #thing ,
I've  ever seen . It #inspires me a lot
and it also motivates me . As we
look at four different #seasons of the 
year , we come to know that all 
of these seasons have their own 
significance , like Spring is the season of
rebirth . It gives us hope of new beginnings 
whenever we feel tired #or dejected . Similarly ,
summer gives us the perspective of #maturity .
Every fruit #or vegetable #gets mature
and old in summer and is ready to
be plucked up . Autumn is also a #season
of hope , when old leaves fall down #into
the ground . It #reminds us of our miseries that
# all miseries and #hardships have to end one 
day . Winter is a beautiful section of all ,
when #everything dies away , a symbol of #mortality .
