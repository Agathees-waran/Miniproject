India is trying for the # recognition of
Kashmir by UN Security Council as a
territory of India to increase and legitimise
its control over Kashmir .
Unfortunately UNSC is powerless to #
stop India because some of its members
donot want # to do so .
Therefore Kashmiris and their International
supporters should raise this issue at most # prominent platform both
through institution# like UN and through media . Kashmiris
are so fed up that they have started protesting for their
freedom . But India regards such actions as terrorist 
activities to prove these actions illegal . 
International supporters # # of Kashmiris should 
not believe in such propagandas because there is 
difference # between ideological driven terrorist group
and desperate national liberation movement .
