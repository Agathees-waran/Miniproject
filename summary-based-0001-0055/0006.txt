We are all hollow men . We have 
eyes but we # # do not 
have the vision to see the reality 
of # life . We depend on each 
other in every aspect of life . we
do not have the courage to 
take a decision by # ourselves and 
stand on our decision . We # learned
from our mistakes , but when time 
passes we do the same mistake 
again . # Justice is banished from 
# this world . We only identify 
faults in others . We do not look 
the positive side of others . We #
# are the Puppets who depends
on other . We # have brain but
we do not use it , we #
# # can not use it #properly .
