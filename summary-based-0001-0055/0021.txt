Awakening the senses :-
Our perception of the physical world 
is dependent on our sense of
touch , sight , sound , taste and
smell . Touch is the # 1st sense that
develops in newborns and remains #
one of the most intimate and
emotional of the sense's throughout 
our lives . The most mysterious 
and evocative is the sense of
smell . It is the most primitive 
of the senses , with a direct 
pathway to the brain's long-term
memory . A smell can # trigger 
some of our deepest memories and feelings .
How instantly the aroma of food or a
particular scent can take us # back to
childhood .
