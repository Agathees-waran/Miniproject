The secret of successful life is
# summed up in ' self-reverence , 
self-knowledge and self #
control ' . A man who # 
does not respect himself will
# never be respected by 
others . If he fails to achieve 
# a certain height # and
goes about with his head 
hanging down , people will think
him # weak and cowardly . 
He should have the courage to
hold # his head high in 
spite of his failures . We 
# never overrate ourselves .
We # never exceed our power .
Self control is even #
more important than the
# other two quantities .
