Since elementary vector methods are freely #
employed throughout this book , some space may
be # given at the outset to # an expla-
nation of the notation used and formulae
required . Vectors are denoted by symbols # .
The position vectors r , of point P relative 
to the origin O , is the vector whose
# magnitude is the length .
# The law of vector addition
is a matter of common knowledge .
If three points O , P , Q are such 
the vectors OP and PQ are 
equal relatively to a & b ,
the vector OQ is called .
Sum some of a and b ,
The negative of vector b is
vector with same modulus .
