For our purposes we want to define
a # basis along the # curve i-e
Which with the # movement of a
point on the curves . A particularly #
convenient basis is provided by moving
trihedron .
For this the first basis vector is the
unit # normal and the unit is 
# binormal . Thus curve is
a # sequence of points
determined by the value of the
# parameter . The curve is
said to be # continous .
A Space # curve is defined to
be in three dimensional space .
In # general it will not
be # possible to find a
plane # containing the curve .
So that the # point will be .
