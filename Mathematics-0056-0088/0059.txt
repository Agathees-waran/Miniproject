Mathematics is the mother 
of Science . Maths is so 
easy Subject . I am 
doing Bs in maths , I like 
math very much . But those 
students who's are not intrested 
in math they fell sorry and 
found it very hard Subject . 
Actually maths is not so hard 
and tough # but their 
teacher's and Socity make 
their minds that's why the 
student did not like math 
as a subject . When you 
have a good teacher and
provide a best environment # 
# it is so easy I love 
maths .
