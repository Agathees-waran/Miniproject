A Space Curve is defined to be a Curve in
3-dimensional Space . In general it will
not be possible to find a plane containing
the curve. By three dimensional space we
mean that #every point will be described
by 3 Numbers . The three numbers are
called Coordinates . we most often # use
cartesian Coordinates so that the point
is given by three distances along 3
mutually perpendicular axes .
