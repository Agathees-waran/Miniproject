Mathematics is the mother of science . 
Mathematics is wide subjects . 
I # like Mathematics very much . It is 
very interesting . Basically I am doing 
BS Mathematics from from Islamia Colleg#e 
Peshawar . In Mathematics we #are 
studying different Topics . we derive 
new equations . Mathematics is very 
Tough . Some people don't like 
Mathematics . It makes our brain fresh . 
Actually Mathematics is # not very 
tough but our # society . makes 
their minds # that's why the 
students didn't like Mathematics . 
when you have a good teacher and
provide a fresh environment Then 
it is very easy . 
I Love Maths .
