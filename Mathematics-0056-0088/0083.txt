A space is define to be # curved 
in three dimensional space . In 
general it will not be # possible 
to find # a plane containing the 
curve . By three dimensional space we 
mean that every point will be described 
by # numbers . ( in general ) , the numbers 
are called coordinate . We most often 
use cartesian cordinates so that the
point is given by three distance . 
The set of three vectors i , j , k 
is called basis ( or a frame ) . A 
particular convenient basis is provided 
by the moving trihedron . For this 
the first basis vector is the unit
tangent # along the curve . 
the next the unit normal and the 
unit binormal .
