A moving trihedron : A space curve is
defined to be a curve in # three dimen- 
sion space . #In general it will not be 
possible to find a plane containing #the 
#curve . By three dimensional space we 
mean # that every point will be 
described by 3 numbers . The three 
numbers are called co-ordinates . 
# We most often use cartesian 
# co-ordinates so that #the point 
is given by three distance along 
mutually perpendicular and having # 
basis vectors being unit # vector 
along 3-axes .
