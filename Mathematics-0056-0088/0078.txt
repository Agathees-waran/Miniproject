=> The Natural Equation : 
The natural equations gives an intrinic
description of the curves # which anable
us to identify the curves .
Here we will deal # with planer
curves only , Here the procedure
adopted can be extented easily .
But # Here the calculation
become complicated .
=> Derivative :
The rate of change of function
with respect # to independent
variable .
=> Ordinary Differential equation :
The ordinary defferential equation
involve # one or more dependent
variable w.r.t only one independent
variable .
