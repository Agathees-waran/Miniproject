Every where we find " x " like we
treat mathematics .
Let # F be a function
of two variables such that
x and y in which we
have to find its slopes ,
graphs , and you have to
draw a table for it .
also the two equation 
are given and we have 
to find the value of
x and y by using 
graph methods . In the 
# question they # # # given
a data and according to
the given data we have
to find a suitable solution
for it .
