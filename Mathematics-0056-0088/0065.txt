Let F be a function of two
variables , such that F has
continuous first partial derivatives
in a domain D . The total
differential dF is #
defined by the formula .
The expression # is
called an exact differential
in a domain D if there exists
a function F of two variables
such that this expression equals
the total differential .
The dependant variable y and 
its various derivatives occur
to the 1st degree only .
