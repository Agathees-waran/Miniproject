Function : 
The term " function " is 
mostly used in mathematics . It 
is a rule that assign two 
value of any two sets . The 
sets must be non-empty . Set A 
will be our domain and set 
B plays the role of range .
There must not be repeatition 
in the domain of a 
function , and every value of 
the domain should be mapped 
with some element of the 
range . Sometimes Set B is 
called co-domain . Only those 
elements of Co-domain will 
be in the set of range 
which should take part in 
the mapping .
