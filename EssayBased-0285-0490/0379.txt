Covid-19 Era
There are people in the world ,
who enjoyed alot in the
Covid Era and , are still enjoying
the situation which Covid-19
brought upon us i-e they can't
wake up early in the morning
to clean themselves for School , College ,
University etc , which they have to
attend must but that is not the
case , I mean afterall it's Covid Era-
People are enjoying the conditions
with full zeal and zest or
you can say enthusiastically . But
I wanted to tell my story that
Covid  affected my life severely : I'm
socially disconnected to the world
and most importantly , my writing skills
became dull and dusted .
