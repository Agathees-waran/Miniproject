" My Fovourite Personality "
My favourite personality is Quaid-e-Azam 
Muhammad Ali Jinnah . I like him the 
most because # he was the founder of 
Pakistan . He give us very facility . 
Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah 
was born at 25 december 1876 in
Karachi . He was the first founder of
Pakistan . He independ the Pakistan at 
14 August 1947 from Hindu . Because 
Hindu want to began a rule on 
Pakistan , And # They prohibit the
Muslims f#rom prayer of Allah . 
And Quiad-e-Azam did not want this 
rule . We are all love with Quaid-e- 
Azam because he was a good ruler of 
Pakistan . We are Pray for his soul . 
At last # he was death at 11 September 
1948 and he was burried in Karachi -
