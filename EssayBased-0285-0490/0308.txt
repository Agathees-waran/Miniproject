My favourite Personality
The history of Muslims are bright , as we see to past
The muslims do work for the Islam and for his
tribe or family . Jalal-ul-din Al-Khwarizmi , The emperor
of subcontinent . and was only person from which
Changize Khan was trabular . Changize Khan was one
of the most cruel person in past . He conqured
half of world but not all subcontinent . Jalal-ul-Din
take a steps for the Islam and for the people of
subcontinent . He fight a lot of wars to Mongols .
Unfortunatly , with the cause of dishonesty , he was not
conqure the china and defeat the Mongols . In
# from 1123-1200 A.D. Jalal-ul-Din was only muslim
emperor , who fight with Mongols . After the
death of Jalal-ul-Din , no one was fight with
Changize Khan . Now adays no one can fight
with wrongfulness .
