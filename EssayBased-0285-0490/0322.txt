I would like to write about
my Grand-mother . She is very
close to my heart because after
the loss of my mother . She
is very dear to me because
the bond is very natural
and real . I cannot explain
my feelings . When I # took
care of her she is very happy
she feels complete . After sitting
with her i feel complete
with her . She made me
realise how parents are
important in our lives and
those Golden memories hits
you hard . So , she completes 
me in a way , the love she
gave me i love her to the
moon and back . She is precious .
