Series :- The Immortal Instrument
Last night I finished one of my favourite series .
It was one of my wish list to finish the whole
series in a week and I am so glad I did it .
Name of the series is Immortal Instru#ment well
basically the series revolves around the face
changer demons the mortal instruments and
the people who fight the demons . This 
Whole series consists of 4 seasons and each
season consists of 13 to 14 episodes . The
main leads had such a great chemistry
and the side couples were love . As I
love supernatural## series I enjoyed watching
this with my sister she is not a fan
of it but she also enjoyed watching it
with me . This series was all I 
wanted during this pandemic as I
stayed at home and was really
unable to go outside .
