I came peshawar for study . so I did addimission
in NUML . In first semester I was really
confused because our base was not good
like any other intelligent student so then
covid-19 spread in country we tood only
one math classic in university . After that we
did not take on-campus classes so we
took online classes and from this our education
affected really badly . Now we feels little
bit good therefore our classes are regular
and we can learn more thing . Now our 
mid exam is on head , and our teachers
are giving us assignment and presentation .
I myself feel good because every thing is
going to a good way . this all I wrote from
different ideas I also start writing to improve
my writing skills Now I am going to
collect it this was instruction to fill
the line . It is worst experince in uni .
