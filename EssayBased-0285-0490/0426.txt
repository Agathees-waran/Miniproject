# Everybody has a way that
Suits them and there are some
good ideas on this thread .
My way would be to just
start writing things about
myself , without much self-censoring ,
just random highlights that come
quickly to mind . When there's
a page or so of these , see
if there are some themes that
Unite the random thoughts , and
Collate them to form a random
thoughts , and collage them to
form a readiable paragraph . During
this process , see if some written items
trigger more of the same or remind
you of something important that was
missing , and add it .
