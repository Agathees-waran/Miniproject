Inequality & its Implication
The gender inequality is more conspicuosely 
manifasted when it comes to 
schooling , Particularly education at
higher level . Cultural boundaries
& various gender roles lead to
different approaches towards
male & female education . In
Pakistan for example , a family
may consider it # useless 
to impart education to girls
because they are supposed to get 
married eventually & to take
on their # major responsibility 
of housemaking and baby
and # babysitting .
