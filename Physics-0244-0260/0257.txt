The minimum amount of energy
required to remove an electron
from the isolated gaseous at is
called electronegitivity . Here are some 
factor which effect the electro 
negativity . When we go in group
from left to right then the
value of # electronegitivity 
because the nuclear charge is 
become greater but there is 
no addition of shells .
When we go from top to 
bottom in a period the
value will be decrease # 
because new shell is added
Enzyme is a biological catalist 
which boost up .
