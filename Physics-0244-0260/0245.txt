" Polar Nature of Water "
=> Water is a polar molecule . The oxygen
end of the molecule is electronegative 
bearing a partial negative charge and the 
hydrogen end is electropositive bearing a
partial negative charge . Water molecules are
bonded to one another through hydrogen
bonds . Hydrogen bonds are much weaker
than covalent bonds but they still
cause water molecules to remain#
attached together .
