" Scientific  Notation "
" Scientific Notation is an easy way of 
writting number that are too big # or 
too small to be written in decimal 
form . " 
In Scientific notation a big number 
as # # the product of the 
number greater than one & less 
than ( 10 ) " ( called the mantissa ) " # & 
a power or exponent of 07 10 =
number = mantissa  × 10 exponent  . 
for example :- if someone writes that
human body contains approximately 7,000,000,000
atoms , it is not only time consuming & 
difficult to write this number # this number 
But there is also a change of error . The 
number of # the atom in the human body 
can thus be written compactty as 7 × 109 # 
where 7 is the mantissa & 9 is the exponent .
