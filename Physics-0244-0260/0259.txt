over the South Pole it is at
the highest point of its #
orbit , 1000 miles above the earth's 
surface . Above the # North Pole
it is at the lowest point of
its orbit , 300 miles above the
earth's surface . The graph of
an equation of the form
where a is non-zero constant
is called Archimedes . spiral 
Is # there anything special
# about the widths between the
# successive turns of such a 
spiral . the orbit is an ellipse
with one focus at the center
